# Project Description: Express.js MongoDB CRUD Template

```bash
This project is an Express.js template for building 
a backend server that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations using a MongoDB database. 
It utilizes the Express.js framework for handling HTTP 
requests, CORS middleware for cross-origin resource sharing, 
and the MongoDB Node.js driver for database interactions.
```

## Key Features:

#### Database Connection:

#### Establishes a secure connection to a MongoDB Atlas database using the provided MongoDB URI. 

```bash
Express.js Server:
Sets up an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests on specified routes.
```
```bash
CORS Middleware:
Implements CORS middleware to enable cross-origin requests and facilitate communication with frontend applications.
```

```bash
CRUD Operations:
Defines routes for basic CRUD operations on a hypothetical "users" collection in the MongoDB database.
```
```bash
Endpoints:
GET /: Returns a welcome message indicating that the backend is operational.
GET /users: A placeholder endpoint for fetching a list of users.
POST /user: A placeholder endpoint for creating a new user.
GET /users/:id: A placeholder endpoint for fetching details of a specific user by ID.
DELETE /users/:id: A placeholder endpoint for deleting a user by ID.
```
```bash
Error Handling:
Basic error handling is incorporated to catch and log any errors during database connection and server operation.
Usage:
```

#### Note : Ensure that a MongoDB Atlas account is set up, and replace the uri variable with your own MongoDB URI.

#### Install dependencies using npm install.
```bash
Run the application using 
$ node server.js
```

This template provides a starting point for developing a scalable and maintainable backend for applications requiring MongoDB integration. Customize the routes, implement additional features, and follow best practices for security and performance to tailor the template to your specific project needs.
